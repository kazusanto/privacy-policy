  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    This app handles only the user-supplied <strong>OpenAI API Key</strong> and the chat messages you send (“<em>User Content</em>”).<br/>
    No other personal data such as your name, email address, or location is collected.
  </p>

  <h2>Purpose of Use</h2>
  <p>The API Key is used solely as an authentication token for accessing the OpenAI API and for no other purpose.</p>

  <h2>Storage and Deletion</h2>
  <p>The API Key is stored in an encrypted state within the device’s <strong>Keychain</strong>. Keychain is Apple’s
    system-level secure storage, protected by the user’s authentication, and is inaccessible to other apps or third
    parties.
    To delete the API Key, tap “Delete API Key” in the settings screen. Note that uninstalling the app may leave the
    Keychain item intact; if so, reinstall the app and press the same button to remove it completely.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
  <p>The API Key is transmitted only to OpenAI when communicating with the OpenAI API and is not shared with any third
    party, including the developer.</p>

  <h2>Data Collected by Third Parties</h2>
  <p>
    OpenAI may retain request and response logs—such as prompts, responses, and IP addresses—for the purposes of abuse monitoring and service quality.
    For retention periods and detailed handling, please refer to the
    <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a>.
